# 2020printer
This is 3D Printer build from 2020 aluminum extrusions.
Characteristics:
- All the linear rails are 10mm (not the normal 8mm)
- The 'wasted space' between the print bed and the enclosure was minimized. One example of this is the x-stepper motor that was move in to make the printer narrower. 
- Most of the design is compatible with the Prusa 3i design so it is possible to exchange some of the axes, e.g it is possible to use use a Prusa i3 Y-axis and heat bed.
